# Hide Autosave Alert

A very simple WordPress plugin that automatically removes the  
**"There is an autosave of this post that is more recent than the version below."**  
message from the block editor.

Helpful for improving development workflow, if you don't care about autosaves.

## Use cases
When working on a custom Gutenberg block, it's on the page. But every time you reload to see changes to code in the browser, it thinks there is an autosave. 

Instead of having to press enter, delete the paragraph, and save... just use this plugin to hide the autosave message.

## Caveats
Not recommended for production usage. 

## âœ¨ Features
- Hides the autosave alert in the Gutenberg editor
- Keeps autosave functionality intact
- Lightweight: no settings, no configuration needed
